PyEELS - Python EELS simulation package
=======================================

PyEELS is a package for simulating and visualize EELS spectra on the basis of model systems in solid state physics.
The usage of the pacage can be seen as three fold:
- Create a Real Space crystal model
- Create or generate band structure in reciprocal space
- Simulate EELS on the model band structures
